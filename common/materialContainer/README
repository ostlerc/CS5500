Use MaterialContainer to create the materials underneath the ground.
These materials will have different properties and different likelihood
of occurance depending on the type of biosphere. Create a biosphere with

auto biosphere = Biosphere::getBasicBiosphere();
auto material = biosphere.getMaterial(5,200,15);
std::cout << material.getName() << std::endl;

OUTPUT:
"Soil"
